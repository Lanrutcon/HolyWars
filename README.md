# HolyWars
WoW AddOn - PvP Notifier

This addOn searches for players who are in Battlegrounds or Arenas and report the numbers of players doing PvP in those instances.
It's meant to be used on small private servers or with low PvP activity.

###How to use it:
---

By default, **HolyWars** will search for Battlegrounds and Arenas. You can only search for only one type. Type in-game: /hw - for more info. 

Everytime you queue for a Battleground or an Arena, the addOn will start search for players. While searching, you won't be able to perform **who searches**. Due to that, on the minimap, the PvP icon will change and return back to it's normal image after looking for all PvP instances.
